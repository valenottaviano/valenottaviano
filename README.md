## About me.
👋 Hi! I'm Valentín Ottaviano, a Junior Data Scientist and full-stack Web Developer based in Tucumán Argentina.

👨‍💻 Currently I'm a collage Software Engeneer student, looking for new challenges and interesting projects. I learned coding by myself, and in 2020 started some freelance projects at local companies.

📚 Outside the tech world, I enjoy reading self develpment and philosophy books. My favorite ones are "Atomic Habits" by James Clear and "El Hombre Mediocre" by José Ingenieros.
